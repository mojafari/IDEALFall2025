# Taking the Plunge: Intro to Drones & AI

Welcome to the official course repository for **IDEAL Fall 2025 – Taking the Plunge: Intro to Drones & AI**.

This course provides an engaging introduction to drone technology, foundational programming, and how artificial intelligence enables drones to interact intelligently with their environment. Through hands-on projects and guided modules, students will explore how drones can be programmed to navigate, recognize objects, and perform simple autonomous tasks using AI techniques.

## Course Goals

- Understand the basic principles of drone flight and operation.
- Learn fundamental programming concepts using Python.
- Explore how AI enables drones to detect and respond to their surroundings.
- Apply computer vision techniques for gesture control, object detection, marker tracking, and other applications.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains modular subfolders that align with different hands-on projects in the course:

- [`Tello_Aruco`](./Tello_Aruco) – ArUco marker tracking with the Tello drone.
- [`Tello_GestureCTRL`](./Tello_GestureCTRL) – Gesture-based control of the Tello using computer vision.
- [`Tello_YOLO`](./Tello_YOLO) – Object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

Each folder contains project-specific code, resources, and instructions.

## Development Environment (Recommended Setup)

We recommend the following development environment:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Virtual environment** (`venv`) for managing dependencies
- **PyCharm Community Edition** (optional but recommended for easier debugging and project management)

> 💡 Students can use any code editor, but PyCharm Community Edition provides built-in support for virtual environments and is recommended for this course.  
> Download here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

## Hardware Requirements

- **DJI Tello (Combo)** – This is the primary drone platform used throughout the course.
- **Optional:** Webcam – Some modules may benefit from a webcam, but it is not required.


## Getting Started

To participate in the projects, you will need:

- A laptop with **Python 3.8+** installed
- **PyCharm Community Edition** IDE
- A DJI **Tello** drone
- **Optional:** Webcam (for some computer vision tasks)
- Install dependencies listed in each subproject's `requirements.txt`
